Website should have a main area that is 3d interactive that slowly spins a model, the first stage of the model is the pre-project area, then it spins into a CAD representation of the area, then a "time lapse" of adding all the design features to the CAD representation, then in the final turn it spins back into a 3D scan of the real & finished project.

Every house that I do should have it's own page explaining the design choices, a before, to cad, to after interactive 3D model, and any lessons that were learned along the way, you can also easily share the design. This way, previous clients will want to share their super interesting 3D model of their project with friends, and I will generate referrals.

Also has a blog / newsletter sign-up area.
